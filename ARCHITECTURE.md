# Architecture

`radar.nvim` is split into a small Neovim UI plugin and a Go backend daemon.

## Components

- `lua/radar/`: Neovim integration, statusline component, notifications, and floating detail window.
- `cmd/radar/`: single Go binary with CLI and daemon mode.
- `internal/server/`: Unix socket API used by Neovim and CLI commands.
- `internal/collector/`: orchestrates ingestion, linking, and resolution.
- `internal/github/`: GitHub ingestion and remote state resolution.
- `internal/git/`: Git worktree ingestion.
- `internal/jira/`: Jira Cloud issue ingestion.
- `internal/linker/`: connects ingested entities to user-facing items.
- `internal/state/`: local persistent item store.

## Process model

There is one long-running daemon per user:

```text
Neovim sessions -> radar CLI -> Unix socket -> radar daemon -> collectors
```

Multiple Neovim sessions share the same daemon and state. This avoids duplicated polling and keeps statusline reads fast.

The binary is intentionally single-file from a user perspective:

```sh
radar daemon
radar status
radar items
radar refresh
radar stop
radar restart
```

## Communication

Neovim does not call GitHub directly. It shells out to `radar`, which talks to the daemon over a Unix socket.

The socket protocol is newline-delimited JSON with a tiny request model:

```json
{ "method": "items" }
{ "method": "summary" }
{ "method": "refresh" }
```

## Item lifecycle

Radar has three active categories and one historical category:

- `immediate`
- `attention`
- `in_progress`
- `done`

Ingestion and linking are separate steps. Ingestion code talks to external systems and produces raw active items/entities. Linker code connects entities from different sources into one user-facing item. Collectors should not blindly import already-completed remote items.

`done` is derived from previously tracked items. If an item was active in the local store and later disappears from the active collector result, the relevant integration checks the remote state. If the remote item resolved today, Radar moves it to `done`.

This keeps `done` meaningful: it means “something Radar was tracking became resolved today.”

## Local state

The daemon stores the latest known items on disk:

```text
$XDG_STATE_HOME/radar/items.json
```

This allows fast startup and lets Neovim show cached information immediately.

## GitHub integration

GitHub access currently uses the `gh` CLI. Radar tracks GitHub core/search rate limits through `gh api rate_limit`. When a budget is low, Radar pauses GitHub collection until GitHub's reset time instead of repeatedly retrying.

Current GitHub collectors:

- review requests assigned directly to the user -> `attention`
- open PRs authored by the user -> `in_progress`

Resolution:

- previously tracked authored PR disappears from open PRs
- daemon fetches that PR remotely
- if it was closed or merged today, it becomes `done`

## Jira integration

Jira integration uses the Jira Cloud REST API directly. Credentials are read from environment variables and are never written to Radar state:

```sh
RADAR_JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-site.atlassian.net
RADAR_JIRA_EMAIL=you@example.com
RADAR_JIRA_API_TOKEN=...
RADAR_JIRA_CLOUD_ID=...
# alternatively: RADAR_JIRA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloud-id>/rest/api/3
```

The Jira collector emits issue entities for assigned non-done tickets. These entities are linked to GitHub PRs and Git worktrees by matching ticket keys such as `ABC-123`.

## Git integration

Git integration collects worktree entities from configured repositories.

Configure roots with:

```sh
RADAR_GIT_REPOS=/path/to/repo:/path/to/another/repo radar daemon
```

If unset, Radar tries the daemon's current working directory.

Worktree entities include path, branch, HEAD, dirty file count, and ahead/behind information when available.

The linker attaches worktrees to GitHub/Jira-style items by matching ticket keys such as `ABC-123` in titles, branches, paths, URLs, or metadata.

Worktrees that do not attach to another item become standalone `in_progress` items, except common base branches like `main`, `master`, `develop`, and `dev`.

## Neovim UI

The statusline is the primary UI and must stay cheap and glanceable.

The floating window is secondary and shows detailed item information. Opening it should use cached daemon state and must not block on network refreshes.

Manual refresh is available from the floating window with `r`. Periodic Neovim statusline updates only load cached daemon state; they must not trigger network refreshes.

## Logging

The daemon writes logs to:

```text
$XDG_STATE_HOME/radar/radar.log
```

Default log level is `info`. Routine polling details should stay at `debug` to avoid excessive disk logging.

Use:

```sh
RADAR_LOG_LEVEL=debug radar daemon
```

for development debugging.
